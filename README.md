# Loan-Management-System-using-MySQL
In the Loan Management System project using MySQL, I imported 5 tables and set customer grades based on applicant income. I calculated monthly and annual interest amounts based on income and property area (rural, urban, semi-urban). Automation was applied through row-level and statement-level triggers to update CIBIL score status and identify ineligible applicants. Data cleaning involved filtering out customers whose loans were not processed or were rejected, and updating gender and age using customer IDs. Finally, I joined all 5 tables into a final dataset and created a stored procedure to generate key outputs, such as filtering high CIBIL score customers and identifying home office or corporate customers.
